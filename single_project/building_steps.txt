Connect the LCD to the Arduino as follows:
* LCD VSS/GND pin to Arduino GND
* LCD VDD/VCC pin to Arduino 5V
* LCD VO pin to the center pin of the potentiometer, or as I did, to the breadboard with a serial connection to the potentiometer
* LCD RS pin to Arduino digital pin 12
* LCD RW pin to breadboard with a serial connection to the GND
* LCD E pin to Arduino digital pin 11

-- Next 4 instructions refer to data pins
* LCD D4 pin to Arduino digital pin 5
* LCD D5 pin to Arduino digital pin 4
* LCD D6 pin to Arduino digital pin 3
* LCD D7 pin to Arduino digital pin 2

* LCD A/BLA pin to breadboard with a serial connection to the power (this will turn on the backlight)
